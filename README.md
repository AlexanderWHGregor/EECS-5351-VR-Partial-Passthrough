# EECS-5351-VR-Partial-Passthrough

This is the user study performed to test the effects of partial passthrough windows on performance and motion sickness in VR. The output data from the study including the statistical analysis can be found here - as well, as the paper produced from the data. Most of the Unity program, including scripts, has been loaded here. However, due to size restrictions some of the project had to be omitted. For the sake of reproducility anybody wishing to receive the full program can email alexanderwhgregor@gmail.com to be sent the zip file.

This work was produced by Alexander Gregor as part of the graudate course EECS 5351 at York University - Lassonde School of Engineering.
