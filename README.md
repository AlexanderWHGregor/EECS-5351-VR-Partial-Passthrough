# EECS-5351-VR-Partial-Passthrough

This is the user study performed to test the effects of partial passthrough windows on performance and motion sickness in VR. The output data from the study including the statistical analysis can be found here - as well, as the [submitted paper](https://alexanderwhgregor.github.io/assets/images/EECS_5351_Final_Paper.pdf). Most of the Unity program, including scripts, has been loaded here. However, due to the proprietary nature of some externally used packages, a portion of the project had to be omitted from this public repository. However, for the sake of reproducility anybody wishing to receive the full program can email alexanderwhgregor@gmail.com to discuss being sent the zip file.

This work was produced by Alexander Gregor as part of the graudate course EECS 5351 at York University - Lassonde School of Engineering.
